# What is  python ?

"""
Python is programming language. It is a high-level, interpreted, interactive,
general-purpose, object-oriented and scripting languages.
"""


# Why Python ?

"""
Python is Booming !. python as a perl programming. 
perl means high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages.

    1. Python is designed to be highly readable. 
    2. Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability
"""


# Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages.

"""
In what terms ?
    1. In terms of number of developers who are using it.
    2. In terms of number of libraries we have.
    3. In terms of number of company who are using it .
"""


# Who is the author of python ?

"""
Python was created by Guido van Rossum. start from 1989 and released in 1991.
Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
"""


# Why called python ?

"""
The Author of python he's a big fan of british comedy movie called as monty python flying circus
and that why he called as python.
"""


# Who are using python

"""
Those people who don't know how to code or how to read code.
"""


# Which version of python

"""
We are using python 3.x
"""


# Node

"""
Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and 
Unix shell and other scripting languages.
"""


# It is used for

"""
    1. Web Development
    2. Software Development
    3. Mathematics
    4. Machine learning
    5. System Scripting
    6. Web scraping
"""


# Which Company uses python

"""
    1. Google
    2. Nasa
    3. Youtube
    4. Dropbox
    5. Yahoo
    6. etc...

# Python Features

"""
    Easy-to-learn
    Easy-to-read
    Easy-to-maintain
    A broad standard library
    Interactive Mode
    Portable
    Extendable
    Databases
    GUI Programming
    Scalable
"""


# Why Easy-to-learn ?

"""
Simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax
"""


# Why Easy-to-read ?

"""
Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
"""


# Why Easy-to-maintain ?

"""
Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
"""


# Why A broad standard library ?

"""
Python library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
"""


# Why Interactive Mode ?

"""
Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
"""


# Why Portable ?

"""
Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
"""


# Why Extendable ?

"""
You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter.
"""


# Why Databases ?

"""
Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
"""


# Why GUI Programming ?

"""
Python supports GUI application.
"""


# Why Scalable ?

"""
Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.
"""


# Why python is interpreted

"""
Do not need to compile you program before executing it. 
"""


# Why Python is Interpreted ?

"""
Because python has two modes 
    1. Normal modes 
    2. Interactive

    1. Normal modes :- 
    The normal mode is the mode where the scripted and finish.py files are run in the python Interpreter

    2.Interactive :-
    Interactive mode is a command line  shell which gives immediate feedback for each statement which running previously
    fed statements in activate    
"""


# Why Python is Object-Oriented ?

"""
Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
"""


# The interpreter

"""
1. Compiler language
2. Interpreter language

    Compiler language
        hello.c --> compiler gcc --> binary --> output hello --> Means binary runs on computer

    Interpreter language
        hello.py --> interpreted python --> interpreter runs on computer and runs program command
"""


# Difference between a compiled language and an interpreted language

"""
    1. A compiler run to create an executable
    2. An interpreter is an executable that loads code and run it on top itself
